# Instagram Reach Analysis 
Instagram reach analysis is a vital topic for social media marketing. This project aims at teaching learners how to use data to analyze their Instagram reach. It involves collecting data on the reach of your past posts and using Python to understand how different factors affect the number of people who see your posts.

# Learning outcomes:

# Data Exploration:  
Use of Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis
# Data Visualization: 
Knowledge of Python in-built tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for creating charts and tables and improved data analysis 
# What it takes to execute this project:

Manually gather ‘reach’ data from Instagram insights about past posts

Import them from CSV file into Python using libraries like Pandas, and clean and organize the data for analysis 

Use Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to calculate different metrics, create data visualization, and identify patterns 

Depending on your data analysis, draw conclusions on which factors influence your Instagram reach 
# Real world applications:
